This folder contains the following data and files that can be used to reproduce the simulation results and figure of the manuscript. Please ensure that your starting path is *papercode* using the papercode.Rproj.

It contains the following:

./figures/:
  fig_sim.jpeg
  Figure 1 of the manuscript.

./results/:
  algos_sol.rds
  A list of two-parameters of the beta, logit-normal, and probit-normal distributions solved by the mcmapper function
  for a grid of prevalence m and c-statistic c values.

  simulation_results.rds
  Processed simulation results.

simulation.R
  An R script that generates the simulation results, stores them, and processes them to create the figure presented in the manuscript.
  Please make sure the working directory is the same as the location of this file.
  If you would like to override interim results and the saved figures, simply delete the results and figures folders (or empty their content). Note that complete replication takes a few hours on an average computer.
  This code uses parallel computing and creates an interim sim_results folder to collecting simulation output.
